Sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine
the overall sentiment or emotional tone expressed in customer reviews of restaurants. 
The goal is to understand whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral. 
Sentiment analysis is not always straightforward,
as it can be influenced by the context, sarcasm, and cultural nuances.
Additionally, some reviews may be mixed in sentiment, so techniques like aspect-based sentiment analysis can be used to identify sentiment
towards specific aspects of the restaurant experience (e.g., food quality, service, ambiance).
